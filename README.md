- a two player game between a person and the computer, we'll use coins
in piles as the example
- is a takeaway game, one of the player has to get the other 
player to take the last coin in the last pile in order to be the winner
- the players and the computer are allowed to take as many coins as wanted from ONLY ONE pile.
- has the same, "default" number of coins in varying piles at beginning of each game/round.
- provides commentary and feedback after each move and encourages the player to keep pushing forward
- keeps a seperate record of the number of coins in piles after a player takes away

It is expected to respond back to the player by taking coins from a pile 
after a player's turn, the bot will give the feedback to players and keep track of
the coins in the piles.
You will be given a view of the number of coins in the piles,
 as well as a blank box to type in how many coins you choose to take 
 and from which pile. It will continue to rotate between player to player until 
 one player is forced to take the last coin.
