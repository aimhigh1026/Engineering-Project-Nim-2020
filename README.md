 - a two player game between a person and the computer, we'll use coins 
  in piles as the example
 - is a a takeway game, one of the player has to get the other 
 player to take the last coin in the last pile in order to be the winner
 - the players and computer are allowed to take as many coins as wanted from
 ONLY ONE pile.
 - has the same, "defult" number of coins in varying piles at beginning of each 
 game/round.
 - provides commentary and feedback after each move and encourages 
 the player to keep pushing forward
 - keeps a separate record of the number of coins in piles after a player
 takes away

It is expected to respond back to the player by taking coins from a pile
 after a player's turn, the bot will give feedback to players and keep track of
 the coins in the piles.
 you will be given a view of the number of coins in the piles,
 as well as a blank box to type in how many coins you choose to take 
 and from which pile. It will continue to rotate between player to player until 
 one is forced to take the last coin.
